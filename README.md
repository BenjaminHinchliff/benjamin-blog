# Benjamin's Blog

So I finally got around to making a blog! As per usual, I decided that a
wordpress blog would be far too easy and I needed over-engineer everything.

It's esentially a wordpress backend (hosted on dreamhost) with a gatsby
frontend (built on gatsby cloud and hosted on netify). Between them there's
a bit of fun DNS configuration to get everything linking. A bit of a mess,
but hey, it works.
